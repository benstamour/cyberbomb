# Bomb Defusing Game

This repository features code for a collaborative game in which one player sees a bomb with a timer and a series of modules, while all of the others see a manual with instructions on how to defuse the bomb. The goal is for the person with the bomb to successfully defuse it before time expires, but in order to do so, they need help from their teammates to instruct them on how to defuse it. Each bomb features a different version of each module along with a different set of instructions to follow. This project was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

For example, here is a sample layout of what the player with the bomb will see:
